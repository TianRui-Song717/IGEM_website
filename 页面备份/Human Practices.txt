              <p style="text-align:center; line-height:2.0em!important; color:#85aa41;">
                More than 800 million people across the world go to bed hungry each night.<br>
                More than thousands of tons of cereals around the world are polluted by heavy metal.<br>
                According to the data from the Environmental Protection Agency in China, heavy metal contaminated cultivated land in China had reached 5,480,000 hectares in 2016, almost 6 times of the size of Beijing.<br>
                So, we want to rehabilitate the land to <b>protect the farmland, increase grain yield and ensure food security.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by One Health, we devised “<b>Beyond the Lab</b>” (Fig. 1) to conduct Integrated Human Practices and “<b>Push the Boundaries</b>” (Fig. 2) to carry on Science Communication.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fig. 1 Beyond the Lab
In order to better reach out and learn from diverse communities, we integrated SCIENCE, SOCIETY and PUBLIC into a new investigation method entitled "<b>Beyond the Lab</b>" (inspired by One Health) to conduct our program “Soil Lead Immobilization Magician” (SLIM). This not only guide us improve the project according to the feedback, but also help us better understand Science Communication. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The health of humans, animals and the environment are closely connected--that’s <b>“One Health”</b>. One Health is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, as the target of our help, farmers and peasants seriously suffered the lowered income as a result of the heavy metal contamination. We carry out Science Communication with the instruction of “<b>Push the Boundaries</b>”, advocating synthetic biology, healthy diet and environment safety in public, so that we can help farmers and peasants to save the loss via improving grain yield and selling heavy-metal-free vegetables with a comparatively higher price to meet the increasing demand of healthy diet. 
              </p>

                A good soil environment makes the seeds germinate and grow better. A promising market makes the project benefit more people and develop better. Therefore, we consulted various stakeholders, including government, agricultural enterprises and farmers to know their concerns and needs, and thus improve and shape SLIM accordingly.

              <h3>The Growth of SLIM</h3>
              <p>
                To get a better understanding of the relations between humans, animals and the environment, we collaborated with One Health association. After taking the advice from One Healthers, we integrated the concept of One Health into our project to shape SLIM. What’s more, inspired by One Health, <b>we documented two thoughtful and creative approaches to conduct our program</b>. One is “Beyond the Lab”, the other is “Push the Boundaries”. Other iGEMers can build upon it.
              </p>

              <!--1 one health-->
              <h4>Collaboration with One Health</h4>
              <p>
                <b>One Health</b> is a collaborative, multi-sectoral, and transdisciplinary approach—working at the local, regional, national, and global levels—with the goal of achieving <b>optimal health</b> outcomes recognizing the interconnection between <b>people, animals, plants, and their shared environment</b>. 
              </p>

              <h6 style="text-align:center;">Fig.3. The Concept of One Health</h6>
              <h6 style="text-align: center;"><i>Provided by One Health Association</i></h6>
              <p>
                <b>One Health Club NAU</b> was founded in 2014 by a group of undergraduates who went to the University of California, Davis for a short visit. The club is now made up of students from different grades and a variety of majors including veterinary medicine, environmental science, business, etc. They focus on promoting <b>interdisciplinary efforts</b>, as well as popularizing One Health concept through both offline promotion and online publicity with a goal of making a difference for a better world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>How do we integrate the concept of One Health into SLIM?</b> On the one hand, the tolerance of earthworms is strengthened, protecting <b>earthworms’ safety</b> (animals). On the other hand, we can address soil environmental pollution (environment), so that we can ensure agricultural development, food safety and human health.
              </p>
              <p>
                We talked with Dr. Osburn, Ms. Brunner and One Healthers in Lunch Time Challenge to share the story of SLIM. With them, we learnt how to explore the communities, institutions, or individuals affected by the problems. Most important of all is that we got kind suggestions and help from Dr. Osburn and Ms. Brunner, which helped to better shape SLIM.

                SLIM has grown up! We distributed a questionnaire on people’s attitude to SLIM and their acceptance of SLIM. We have noticed that most people were concerned about food safety but knew little about heavy-metal contaminated vegetables. If they could know more about these vegetables and would like to pay a bit more to buy them, farmers could benefit more. We need to greatly enhance public education. That is our <b>SCIENCE COMMUNICATION</b>.

                At first, we planned to solve an emvironmental problem. One Health inspired us that we can do much more than that, because people, animals and environment are closely connected.  We can protect food safety and human health while solving the environmental problem. Farmers, the biggest stakeholder, can earn more income. Agricultural economy can be promoted. SLIM has been influencing the world and the world has been influencing SLIM.

                We called Wang Ping, who said their income reduced obviously. He said that vegetables were attacked by pests, while the only solution he could come up with was the application of pesticides and fertilizers. It seemed that vegetables grew better in a short period of time. However, with high frequency of pesticides and fertilizers application,<b> the soil was unhealthier and was inclined to agglomerate, and there were indeed fewer earthworms, </b>resulting in a serious decline in vegetable quality and yield. He consequently suffered lower income. 
              </p>
              <p>
                 Pesticides and fertilizers contain lots of heavy metals. We assume there were some relations between heavy metals, soil health, earthworms and vegetables.<b> This little assumption inspired us to use earthworms to improve the heavy metal contaminated farmlands to increase farmland yield. </b>We do really want to help peasants, like Wang Ping, reduce the economic loss.

                We interviewed an official in Environmental Protection Bureau offline. She said,"In China, there are many areas polluted by heavy metals, especially in the south. Among heavy metals, lead, cadmium, nickel have serious impacts on human body. <b>Lead can enter human body through vegetables and grains, causing great harm to the nervous system.</b> For example, in Chenzhou, Hunan province, where villagers suffered from lead pollution. Most villagers made a living by farming, so they were exposed to soil, crops, water and even air with leads every day. In other words, what they ate, drunk and even breathed in has been severely polluted. There were only 23,000 children in Chenzhou, but over half of them were found to have excessive levels of lead in their blood. They had symptoms like weakened immune systems, slow growth and lack of concentration.

                We interviewed Xiao Yuan, an agricultural enterpriser, via Wechat. She said, “Before planting, <b>soil health is the first factor to be considered.</b> The most common soil problem is heavy metal pollution. The sources of pollution are not only from factories, but from the chemical fertilizers and pesticides. I have known about the way of using earthworms to improve soil, but <b>what I’m concerned about most is the cost.</b> As we all know, it’s much more than just the cost of SLIM earthworms. The expenses of labour and technique and the loss of earthworms all should be considered. <b>If your method is cheaper and more effective than others, I’ll adopt yours.”</b>

In my views, what people care about most is their health and freedom from disease. We often fail to consider the environmental role with health problems affecting people, plants and animals. The topic your team has selected to study, lead toxicity, is an excellent example of an environmental problem affecting human health. Young children are often affected with lead poisoning because of contaminated air, water or foods. Lead toxicity can affect neurological and cognitive development. There is a need for creative thinking of ways to mitigate the toxic effects of lead that is in the environment, so finding new ways of detoxifying the chemical or partitioning it out of the food or water supply is also attractive.”</i>

Once it enters animals and people it causes illness and even death.  For this reason, it is important that we attempt to find ways to prevent plant, animal and human illnesses.  We care about the health of the soil as it relates to the health of ALL living things.  One Health is a difficult thing to translate to a farmer who is concerned about meeting financial obligations. When you can demonstrate that having healthy soil will allow him or her to grow more crops and make more money and provide healthy food for his or her family, and the community, the light bulb goes off and it becomes easier to make the connection between the health of the soil and the health of people.”</i>

In children, the toxicokinetic of lead includes absorption through the intestine via iron and calcium transporters, transferring to the blood (99% in rbc and 1% in serum), distribution to soft tissues (e.g. brain and kidney), and storage in the bone.  The bone lead remains throughout one’s life and might re-enter the blood when there is bone loss during aging. There is a strong relationship between blood and impaired cognitive development at all blood lead levels. There is no blood level thought to be safe.

              <p>
                There’s much insoluble phosephorus but little soluble phosephorous, so we intended to produce phsphate enzyme which can transform insoluble phosephorus into soluble one. Then the soluble phosephorus combines with lead. According to the census shared by Professor Guo, polluted areas are often near lead-zinc deposits, like southwest and middle-of-south in China. We aimed to apply our project to southern China.</b>

            <p>
              “Have you thought about the PH of phosphatase?” <br>After searching for data, we found that the pH in soil is not the optimal PH of phosphatase, then we changed phosphatase to PHYTASE.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>“Although previous research on the formation of pyromorphite was carried out in the water system, it can be extended to the soil system. It is also safe to treat lead ions by forming pyromorphite in the soil environment, because pyromorphite is extremely stable, and effective lead cannot be extracted with TCLP (US EPA standard). In addition, many phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in the soil are very tolerant to lead and are basically unaffected.  Organic bonding state of lead in soil and other forms may affect the formation of pyromorphite, but it should not be very serious, because from the chemical balance, pyromorphite is almost the most stable lead-containing mineral. If you want to analyze and prove whether there is pyromorphite formed in the soil environment. XRD is the most effective method. Besides, <b>have you thoght about the PH of phosphatase?</b>”</i>

            <p>
              Engineered bacteria cannot beat against wild strains. Earthworms are tolerant to heavy metals to a certain extent. <b>This inspired us to find a home for bacteria, earthworms.</b>

              <i>“In fact, there are plants using earthworms to remove the heavy metals in excrements of livestock and poultry. The excrements contain heavy metals, and earthworms are tolerant to it. Moreover, feed is sometimes detected with heavy metals. This has a huge impact on animal productivity, causing a considerable economic loss to stock-breeding. It can also affect human health through the food chain.”</i>
