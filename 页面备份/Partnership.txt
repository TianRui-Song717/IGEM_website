                  Our project aimed to<b> handle soil heavy metal pollution</b> under the circumstances that current methods, like plant treatment and physicochemical treatment,<b> couldn’t solve the problem completely</b>. To make up for the possible <b>damage to soil </b>caused by current methods, we came up with a new method using<b> synthetic biology</b>for restoring soil. We combined earthworms with engineered bacteria to<b> secrete phosphate-solubilizing enzyme (PSE)</b> to combine lead into<b> precipitation complex</b>. In this way, the soil could plant while treating heavy metal.

                     Nanjing-China members asked us if we had any ideas about the engineered bacteria. We discussed for a while and agreed that our engineered bacteria should <b>be dominant in the environment and have strong secretory ability</b>. The next few weeks, we searched for information in this direction and decided to use <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> because it was gram-positive bacterium as well as the dominant bacteria both in the environment and earthworm intestine. It also had powerful secretory ability that we needed.

                  We had designed our circuit and <b>explained the mechanism of treating lead pollution to Nanjing-China team</b>: when earthworm ate the soil, the engineered bacteria secreted enzyme in the intestine and turned phosphorus into phosphate radical to form stable pyromorphite with lead. Then our engineered bacteria triggered kill switch when they were excreted outside so that no bio-pollution could be caused.

                    Nanjing-China tried to combine polyphosphates with recombinant spider silk protein, but they could not <b>occur electrostatic interaction</b>. Then, we advised them to change some of the amino acids in the N’ terminal and C’ terminal into positively charged amino acids.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These problems were very important to us. We also thought we needed to take <b>ion product </b>and <b>Ksp</b> of the reaction into account. In the meanwhile, we needed to check the <b>concentration of phosphate, lead ion and chloride ion</b>, which required the relevant information provided by the mathematic model members. With the advice of some professors and our own calculations, we <b>solved the problem</b> by July: we calculated that the ion product of pyromorphite was between 10<sup>-20</sup>~10<sup>-30</sup> and its Ksp is about 10<sup>-60</sup>~10<sup>-80</sup>, which was far enough to meet the conditions for precipitation. Therefore, even if other ions existed, pyromorphite would still be generated in priority for its smaller Ksp.

                  We had considered this problem before and designed the preliminary circuit. We designed the <b>Toehold Switch</b>. Only when the transcribed Trigger RNA was accumulated in earthworm intestine, the transcribed Switch RNA could be turned on in the aerobic environment and released the suicide gene.

                    Nanjing-China members said that although the engineered bacteria couldn’t commit suicide in the lab, continuous transcription of switch RNA was a pressure on them. We took their advice and made adjustments.

                  We added IPTG induction system to express CⅠ protein and inhibit the transcription of switch RNA in the lab so that there was no extra pressure on engineered bacteria.

                    Due to the lack of experiments, data acquisition has always been a problem for us, especially data such as DNA transcription rate and mRNA translation rate. Under the recommendation of Nanjing-China, <b>we applied De Novo DNA ( <a href="https://www.denovodna.com">https://www.denovodna.com</a>) to calculate relevant data</b>, which improved the accuracy of model data acquisition and laid a foundation for the later model establishment.

                    We had a communication with Nanjing-China, and discussed the issue of uploading the code to the official website. The main reason is that Nanjing-China wants to make vertical layout, and finally add "Vertical- Align: Middle". The problem has been solved and the friendship between the two teams has been promoted on the basis of previous communication.

                    We exchanged some idea with Nanjing-China about <b>the design of our logo</b>, and received some helpful suggestions. In the beginning, we designed two logos respectively with the theme of earthworm and engineered bacteria. When we were hesitating to choose one, Nanjing-China advised that we can choose the logo with soil element, giving that soil element can express the theme of our project——environment protection better.

                    We designed the earthworm as a ring with a gap, and fill in a little bit black to represents the clitellum of earthworm. Nanjing-China suggested that we can enhance the balance of design by adjusting the position of the gap and clitellum and the size of bud, and use more arcs to make the image of the earthworm three-dimensional. <b>With the help of Nanjing-China, we perfected our design of logo</b>, planning to make an animation of logo to emphasize the existence of earthworm.

                      Nanjing-China asked us about the recent experiments. After learning that Nanjing-China have carried out in vivo experiments on binding polyP and GFP, we asked them <b>whether they have also done in vivo binding experiments</b>, and reminded them that they should <b>pay attention to their in vivo binding conditions</b>. Nanjing-China did carry out these experiments later and showed that +36GFP and polyP could be synthesized simultaneously in vivo and directly combined in bacteria.
