              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p style="text-align:center; line-height:2.0em!important; color:#85aa41;">
                More than 800 million people across the world go to bed hungry each night.<br>
                More than thousands of tons of cereals around the world are polluted by heavy metal.<br>
                According to the data from the Environmental Protection Agency in China, heavy metal contaminated arable land in China had reached 5,480,000 hectares in 2016, almost 6 times of the size of Beijing.<br>
                So, we want to rehabilitate the land to <b>protect the farmland, increase grain yield and ensure food security.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by One Health, we created a method called “Beyond the Lab” (shown in Fig. 1) to conduct Integrated Human Practices and another one called “Push the Bondaries” (shown in Fig. 2) to carry on Science Communication.
              </p>
              <img src="" alt="Beyond the lab">
              <h6>Fig.1. Beyond the Lab</h6>
              <p>
                In order to better reach out and learn from diverse communities, we organically combined SCIENCE, SOCIETY and PUBLIC, forming a new investigation method called <b>“Beyond the Lab”</b>(inspired by One Health) to conduct our program “Soil Lead Immobilization Magician” (SLIM). This can not only guide us how to improve the subject according to the feedback, but also help us better understand Science Communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The health of humans, animals and the environment are closely connected--that’s <b>“One Health”</b>. One Health is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, whom we want to help most is farmers and peasants, whose income is seriously damaged by the heavy metal contamination. We carry out Science Communication with the instruction of “Push the Boundaries” to call on people to know more about synthetic biology and care about their food safety and environment, so that we can help farmers and peasants to save the loss with the increasing demand in heavy-metal-free vegetables.
              </p>

                The SLIM project is like a seed. Now let’s see how SLIM help build a better future!

                A good soil environment can make the seeds germinate and grow better. A promising market can make the project develop better. Therefore, we consulted various stakeholders, including government, agricultural enterprises and farmers to understand their concerns and needs, and thus improve and shape SLIM.

              <p>
                To get a better understanding of the relations between humans, animals and the environment, we collaborated with One Health association. After taking the advice from One Healthers, we integrated the concept of One Health into our project to shape SLIM. What’s more, inspired by One Health, <b>we documented two thoughtful and creative approaches created two approches to conduct our program.</b> One is “Beyond the Lab”, another is “Push the Boundaries”, that other iGEMers can build upon it.
              </p>

              <!--1 one health-->
              <h4>Collaboration with One Health</h4>
              <p>
                <b>One Health</b> is a collaborative, multi-sectoral, and transdisciplinary approach—working at the local, regional, national, and global levels—with the goal of achieving <b>optimal health</b> outcomes recognizing the interconnection between <b>people, animals, plants, and their shared environment</b>.
              </p>
              <img src="" alt="One Health">
              <h6 style="text-align: center;">Provided by One Health Association</h6>
              <p>
                <b>One Health Club NAU</b> was founded in 2014 by a group of undergraduates who went to the University of California, Davis for a short visit. The club is now made up of students from different grades and a variety of majors including veterinary medicine, environmental science, business, etc. They focus on promoting <b>interdisciplinary efforts</b>, as well as popularizing One Health concept through both offline promotion and online publicity with a goal of making a difference for a better world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>How do we integrate the concept of One Health into SLIM?</b> On the one hand, the tolerance of earthworms is strengthened, protecting earthworms’ safety (animals). On the other hand, we can adress soil environmental pollution (environment), so that we can ensure agricultural development, food safety and human health.
              </p>
              <p>
                We talked with Dr. Osburn, Ms. Brunner and One Healthers in Lunch Time Challenge to share the story of SLIM. With them, we learnt how to explore the communities, institutions, or individuals affected by the problems. Most important of all is that we got kind suggestions and help from Dr. Osburn and Ms. Brunner, which helped to better shape SLIM.

              <h3>The Future of SLIM</h3>
              <p>
                SLIM has grown up! Farmers could benefit more if public acceptance of heavy metal-pollution-free vegetables is high. We released a questionnaire to know their <b>attitude and acceptance</b> to SLIM. We’v noticed that most people were concerned about food security but knew little about heavy-metal contaminated vegetables. So we need to enhance public education, that’s in our <b>SCIENCE COMMUNICATION</b>.
              </p>
              <ul style="float:left;width:100%;list-style:none;">

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At first, we just wanted to solve a small problem of environment. One Health told us that people, animals and environment are closely connected. We can do much more than that. We can protect food safety and human Health. Farmers, the biggest stakeholder, can get more income, promoting agriculture economy. SLIM has been affecting the world and the world has been affecting SLIM.

                We called Wang Ping，who said their income reduced obviously. He said that vegetables were attacked by pests, while the only solution he could come up with was the application of pesticides and fertilizers. It seemed that vegetables grew better in a short period of time. However, with high frequency of pesticide and fertilizer application,<b> the soil was unhealthier and was inclined to agglomerate, and there were indeed fewer earthworms, </b>resulting in a serious decline in vegetable quality and yield. He consequently suffered lower income.
              </p>
              <p>
                 Pesticides and fertilizers contain lots of heavy metals. We assume there were some relations between heavy metals, soil health, earthworms and vegetables.<b> This little assumption inspired us to use earthworms to improve the heavy metal contaminated farmlands to increase farmland yield. </b>We do really want to help peasants, like Wang Ping, reduce the economic loss.

                We interviewed an official in Environmental Protection Bureau offline. She said, “In China, there are many areas that are polluted by heavy metals, especially in the south. Among heavy metals, lead, cadmium, nickel have a serious impact on the human body. <b>Lead can enter the body through vegetables and grains, causing great harm to the nervous system.</b> For example, in Chenzhou, Hunan province, where villagers suffered from lead pollution. Most villagers made a living by farming, so they were exposed to soil, crops, water and even air with leads every day. In other words, what they ate, drunk and even breathed in has been severely polluted. There were only 23,000 children in Chenzhou, but over half of them were found to have excessive levels of lead in their blood. They had symptoms like weakened immune systems, slow growth and lack of concentration. Although it’s been 10 years and the environment has been improved, <b>the soil is still in medium pollution.</b>”

                We interviewed Xiao Yuan on the Wechat, an agricultural enterpriser. She said, “Before planting, <b>soil health is the first factor to be considered.</b> The most common soil problem is heavy metal pollution. The sources of pollution are not only from factories, but from the chemical fertilizer and pesticides. I have known about the way of using earthworms to improve soil, but what I’m concerned about most is the cost. As we all know, it’s much more than just the cost of SLIM earthworms. The expenses of labour and technique and the loss of earthworms all should be considered. <b>If your method is cheaper and more effective than others, I’ll adopt yours.”</b>Soil health is a primary consideration for agricultural producers, and we need to consider the <b>efficiency</b> of the project.

                Due to lead pollution，grain yield has decreased，causing an economic loss to farmers. Heavy metal contaminated vegetables and crops are affecting health of people.

In my views, what people care about most is their health and freedom from disease. We often fail to consider the environments role with health problems affecting people, plants and animals. The topic your team has selected to study, lead toxicity, is an excellent example of an environmental problem affecting human health. Young children are often affected with lead poisoning because of contaminated, air, water or foods. Lead toxicity can affect neurological and cognitive development. There is a need for creative thinking of ways to mitigate the toxic effects of lead that is in the environment, so finding new ways of detoxifying the chemical or partitioning it out of the food or water supply is also attractive."

Once it enters animals and people it causes illness and even death.  For this reason, it is important that we attempt to find ways to prevent plant, animal and human illnesses.  We care about the health of the soil as it relates to the health of ALL living things.  One Health is a difficult thing to translate to a farmer who is concerned about meeting financial obligations. When you can demonstrate that having healthy soil will allow him or her to grow more crops and make more money and provide healthy food for his or her family, and the community, the light bulb goes off and it becomes easier to make the connection between the health of the soil and the health of people.”</i>

The bone lead remains throughout one’s life and might re-enter the blood when there is bone loss during aging. There is a strong relationship between blood and impaired cognitive development at all blood lead levels. There is no blood level thought to be safe.

The sources of heavy metals are very extensive, like industrial pollution, pesticide residues and automobile exhaust. The pollution can be divided into two parts-- exogenous pollution and endogenous pollution. The former like pesticide residues and bacteria can be easily eliminated through common wash and cooking, but the latter not. So, the only way to prevent it is to stop the gathering in vegetables. That is to solve the environmental problem. In China, 12 million tons of vegetables and crops are polluted by heavy metals every year, causing an economical loss of 20 billion yuan. The biggest losers are peasants.” Ms. Xu advised us to get more information from the policy released by the government, Control of Soil Risk Management in Agricultural Land, from which we knew heavy metals pollution is widespread in China.

                  “Although previous research on the formation of pyromorphite was carried out in the water system, it can be extended to the soil system. It is also safe to treat lead ions by forming pyromorphite in the soil environment, because pyromorphite is extremely stable, and effective lead cannot be extracted with TCLP (US EPA standard). In addition, many phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in the soil are very tolerant to lead and are basically unaffected.  Organic bonding state of lead in soil and other forms may affect the formation of pyromorphite, but it should not be very serious, because from the chemical balance, pyromorphite is almost the most stable lead-containing mineral. If you want to analyze and prove whether there is pyromorphite formed in the soil environment. XRD is the most effective method.”

                “In fact, there are plants using earthworms to remove the heavy metals in excrements of livestock and poultry. The excrements contain heavy metals, and earthworms are tolerant to it. Moreover, feed is sometimes detected with heavy metals. This has a huge impact on animal productivity, causing a considerable economic loss to stock-breeding. It can also affect human health through the food chain.”

            </ul>
            <p>
              We planned to use Bucillus subtilis as engineered bacterium, and we added a kill switch to ensure the bio-safety.

            <p>
               “Bucillus subtilis is the dominant bacteria in soil. There are many benefits of microorganisms interacting with plants: microbes help with biocontrol of other microorganisms, promote nitrogen fixation, provide growth through hormones, allow for nutrients to be recycled and stabilize soil preventing erosion.”
